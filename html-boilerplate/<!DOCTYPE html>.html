    <p>Clare is so <strong><em>gay</em></strong>, and I love her so much. She's so cute, sweet and I'm so happy each and every time that I get to see her. I can't help but smile whenever I do, she's just so perfect and I'm lucky to call her my girlfriend.</p>
    <p><em>So in theory, this all works. But I just want to say that I really do appreciate her, she's so lovely.</p></em>
